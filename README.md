# School_Projects
A Repository for school projects

Audiobook_Review_Site:
    This is a website for reviewing Audiobooks.  It was the final project for
    my Web Development Class.  It is hosted at: 
    
    http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~boalm/cs494/final_site/final.html

    If you want to try to log in, you can use the user: test and password: test

    This was the first website I built from the ground up.  Some of the code design
    could be improved upon, but it works and I learned a ton from this project.

    The project uses PHP, Javascript (and a little JQuery), HTML, CSS, and MySQL for
    the database.

Small_shell:
    This was made in my operating systems class.  It is a linux shell we created with
    limited functionality.  Most commands are automatically grabbed using execvp().  
    I wrote scripts for the commands: status, cd, and exit.  

    This was written in C.


    
I will add more projects to here over time.

Thanks and have a great day!
